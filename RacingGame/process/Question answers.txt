31. What’s the difference between an array and an ArrayList?
- Arrays can only be a predetermined length (which gets decided when the array is declared).
- ArrayLists have a variable length, so elements can continually be added / removed from them.


32. Why would you want to go through a list backwards, decrementing the index?
- Decrementing can be useful for various reasons. For example, copying the elements of an array into another array (but in reverse order),
  displaying all of an array's elements from last to first, etc.


37. When should you use PVector instead of float variables?
- PVector should be used whenever you are calculating object positions & anything physics-related (i.e. movement, acceleration, gravity, etc).


19. What’s the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
- A 'for loop' iterates through the loop a set number of times (i.e. i = 0; i < 10)
- A 'while loop' iterates through the loop while a condition is true, which could change at any time (i.e. while playerPosX > 10)


22. What’s the difference between parameters and arguments?
- Arguments are *passed* to functions, while parameters are *within function definitions*.
- i.e. "void movePlayer(float x, float y)" has 2 parameters, while "movePlayer(5,6)" has 2 arguments.


42. What is a normalized vector, why is it useful?
- A normalized vector is any vector that is edited so the magnitude doesn't exceed 1.
- This is useful, because some games apply vertical and horizontal acceleration differently, leading to some players getting an unfair boost if they only move diagonally.


25. What’s the difference between a class and an object?
- A class defines an object, while an object is a single instance.


26. What is a constructor function? What does it do and when?
- A constructor function is used to initialize any object from a class.
- It gets called when an object is first created / instantiated, and is responsible for assigning values to the object's variables.


27. Why should each class have its own tab in Processing?
- Having each class be a separate tab is good for modularity.
- As programs get more and more complicated, having multiple classes all within one tab would be difficult to scroll through and organize.
